	<p> Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function that do not involve changes 
		in the DNA sequence. </p>

	<p> Genetic testing has potential benefits whether the results are positive or negative for a 
	gene mutation. Test results can provide a sense of relief from uncertainty and help people make 
	informed decisions about managing their health care.</p>

	<p>A decade ago, researchers completed what was one of the greatest scientific achievements of our
	time when they decoded the last of the three billion letters that make up the human genome. Since 
	then, the cost of sequencing has dropped dramatically â€“ from $3bn for the first human genome to a 
	few thousand dollars today.</p>
